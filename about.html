            &ensp; Hello! My name is Johanna Wichmann. I am a third year Computer Science major at Rochester Institute of Technology
    looking to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelor of Science. I have been interested in technology for a lot of my life
    especially when I had joined technology class in middle school. That led me to join a robotics club and learning
    how to build robots and code them to compete in obstacle courses. From there, I've slowly been learning on my own
    and through classes in high school about code and computer science. Besides technolgy, I also love anything in 
    the liberal arts like music, reading, and writing. I've played to clarinet since I was 10 and it has followed 
    me for most of my life. I have also read hundreds of books throughout my life and english has always been another 
    big passion of mine. I am driven to learn more about technology and the liberal arts.
